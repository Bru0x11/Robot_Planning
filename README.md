# Robot_Planning-Coordinated_Evacuation
This repository is a student project developed by Ashkan Alami, Edoardo Barba and Matteo Brugnera for the "Robot Planning and its application" course of the Master in Artificial Intelligent Systems at the University of Trento, a.y. 2022-2023.

In this project we focus on the evacuation of multiple robots from the same room, filled with obstacles, with particular emphasis on the definition of motion planning and coordination strategies that will be applied to perform this task in the fastest way possible. 

More information can be found in the project report.
